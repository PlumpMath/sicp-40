;;; Assuming `p` is \\(O(1)\\), the time and space complexity are directly proportional to the
;;; number of times `p` is applied

;;; `(sine a)` will make at most \\(n\\) calls to `p` where \\(n\\) satisfies the equation

;;; \\(\frac{a}{3^n} \leq 0.1\\)

;;; Solving for \\(n\\)

;;; \\(\log _3 a \leq n\\)

;;; Therefore the \\(O(sine)\\) is approximately \\(\log _3 a\\), with `a` as input
