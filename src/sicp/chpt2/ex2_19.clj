;;; No the initial ordering doesn't matter as long as the same
;;; ordering is maintained throughout subsequent calls

;;; The problem is defined in terms of 2 sub problems

;;; The first problem calculates the number of ways to count change
;;; without one of the denominations but the same amount

;;; The second problem calculates the number of ways to count change
;;; with the same denomination list but with the amount reduced by the
;;; first value in the demoniation list

;;; Both functions make the assumption that the initial order doesn't change,
;;; they track the state of the system that way.
